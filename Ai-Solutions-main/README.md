# Ai-Solutions
Research Assistant Website 

# About the project
This website is a current demo model for a Chatbot. You may ask, isn't AI a bubble soon to burst? Well this project has been ideated more so as tool to assist students, businesses and really anyone looking to streamline their hyper-focused research, especially in data heavy use-cases.

# What's the website made with?
The website is currently a skeleton of it's full potential, as there has not been agent integration yet as we are students and we don't have that type of allowance. Nevertheless the application has a python and Flask API backend , python is highly mutable and as junior devs we decided to use Flask over Django as it felt easier to learn. CSS, HTML, and JavaScript has been used in tandem with our Python/Flask backend connected with the Jinja templating tools.
